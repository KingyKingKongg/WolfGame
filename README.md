# WolfGame

Note that I used linux to write this code. so the OS command for clearing the terminal may be different to other users.
The script will create a database for you and every time the game is played it will delete the table and recreate it with different characters. It is very basic to guess the were wolf, but again, this is mainly focused to the basics of sqlite3.

Feel free to give me tips on making it better or ways to add to the game to improve it.
